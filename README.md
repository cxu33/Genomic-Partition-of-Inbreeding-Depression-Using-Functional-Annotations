# Genomic-Partition-of-Inbreeding-Depression-Using-Functional-Annotations
This study identifies functional genomic regions that disproportionately contribute to inbreeding depression in milk, protein, and fat yields of U.S. Jersey cattle. By analyzing 245,517 cows, researchers pinpointed where harmful mutations accumulate, providing a roadmap to mitigate productivity losses. These findings will help dairy breeders optimize genomic selection, reducing economic losses from inbreeding while maintaining herd productivity and sustainability. The work has significant implications for the dairy industry's long-term genetic management and profitability.
